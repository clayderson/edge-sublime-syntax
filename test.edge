<h2> Need to make sure HTML works fine </h2>

Also we should be able to write JS inside {{ 2 + 2 }} or {{ user.username }}

{{-- Let's write some comments --}}

@if(username)
    <p> Hello {{ username }} </p>
@else
    <p> Hello Guest </p>
@endif

@component('alert', type = 'error')
@endcomponent

How about self closing tags

@!each(user in users, include = 'partials.user')

Also keywords like
@debugger
@super

With some HTML comments
<!-- Edge has nothing to do with this -->

You can instruct edge to skip the processing of mustache.
@{{ This will never be processed }}

Also for multiple markup you can use the raw tag

@raw
    Everything inside me will be skipped.
    @section('sidebar')
    @endsection
    <h2> Some html </h2>
@endraw
